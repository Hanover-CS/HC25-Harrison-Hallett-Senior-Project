## Rogule
https://rogule.com/

This is a website that runs a simple roguelike game in your browser. Primary Source.

This would be a competing roguelike game, but also a simple game that can help me visualize my own game design.

Rogule is a web browser Roguelike that has a new dungeon every single day, and your only allowed one attempt per day. It's a very simple game in which you move around using the arrows on you keyboard as you move through the dungeon. In the dungeon you fight enemies and break things to collect items, which are used to help complete the level.

One feature that could relate to my goal with this game is that it can be played in a web browser, which is probably the direction my game will end up going. I've done a very simple game in a web browser before during my freshman May term so hopefully I can put that expierence to use. Another feature that I will probably try to emulate is having objects such as boxes, jars, or other breakable things that could contain items helpful for the run like food for health. One thing I do not like about this solution is that avatars for enemies and the player is basically just a moving emoji, and I'm hoping to create something a little more detailed than that. Another concept that I think is cool is as you progress through the dungeon the walls at the edge of your vision turn grey, and then they disappear. I like this because it gives a little imersion by forcing you to pay attention to where your going, and where you've been. Also, it is a turn based game, but the enemies move right after you take a step, and it feel very smooth and I didn't notice any delay before it was my turn again. I play a lot of grand strategy games where the AI has a lot more to consider, so I didn't even consider a turnbased game. I still would like to make it real-time, but this could be an easy solution if I need to downsize.

## Arx Fatalis
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arx_Fatalis

This is the wikipedia page for the game Arx Fatalis which can be bought on steam or played from CD if anyone does that anymore. Secondary Source.

This is a resource that I would use in completion of my game.

Arx Fatalis is an old open world first perosn RPG that released in 2002. It has very interesting mechanics for spellcasting, where you must draw runes using your mouse to cast spells. As you play through the game you can unlock more runes which unlocks more combinations, widening your range of spells. It also takes place completely underground in a massive cave system, and the progression through the tunnels has inspired me to make a game with a similar feel.

The main feature from this game that is related to my goal is the drawing of runes to use spells. I find it very exciting as an idea in both game lore and game mechanics. The idea being that to use magic you must draw runes in the air in front of you, and different runes and combinations give different effects. I'm not quite sure how to implement something like this, but it is a definite goal of mine. I also think that I may use the idea of gathering runes as a reward for making it farther into the dungeon which will power you up as you go. I'm not sure if the runes would be something that you can keep between runs, or maybe the runes will determine how you play your run as your using the tools you've been given.
