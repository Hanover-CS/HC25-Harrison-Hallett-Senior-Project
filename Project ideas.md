# My Project Ideas

## RogueLike game
### A roguelike game that takes inspiration from a game I found over the summer called Arx Fatalis. In that game you must draw symbols with your mouse to use spells or powers which seemed really cool to me. The idea would be to take that system and apply it to a super basic dungeon crawler, where you progress through a dungeon, fight enemies, and find loot.
