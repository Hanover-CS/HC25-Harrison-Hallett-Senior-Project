# My Project Ideas

## RogueLike game
A roguelike game that takes inspiration from a game I found over the summer called Arx Fatalis. In that game you must draw symbols with your mouse to use spells or powers which seemed really cool to me. The idea would be to take that system and apply it to a super basic dungeon crawler, where you progress through a dungeon, fight enemies, and find loot.

## Ceramics app
* Pictures of work with specific glazes on them for reference
* Feature that will do all the math that comes with making glazes for you
* "Standard Weights and Measures"
* Hanover Ceramics Hall of Fame
* Easy enough  to use that it can still be usefull after I'm gone

## German Vocab Mobile app
A app that would be very similar to quizlet or duolingo, but the major focus is just memorizing vocab.
