Watching a streamer play this game over the summer is what inspired me to try and make a game for my thesis project. I'm not sure if it's feasable for me to make work very quickly, but I love the idea of this magic system, and would love to incorporate my own spin on it in my game. The system works by drawing runes with your mouse, and combinations of these ruins allow you to cast powerful magic. As the game progresses you get more

### Rogule
Rogule is a web browser Roguelike that has a new dungeon every single day, and your only allowed one attempt per day. It's a very simple game in which you move around using the arrows on you keyboard as you move through the dungeon. In the dungeon you fight enemies and break things to collect items, which are used to help complete the level. [4]

A feature that I will probably try to emulate is having objects such as boxes, jars, or other breakable things that could contain items helpful for the run like food for health. One thing I do not like about this solution is that avatars for the enemies and the player are basically just moving emojis, and I'm hoping to create something a little more detailed than that. Another concept that I think is cool is as you progress through the dungeon the walls at the edge of your vision turn grey, and then they disappear. I like this because it gives a little imersion by forcing you to pay attention to where your going, and where you've been. Also, it is a turn based game, but the enemies move right after you take a step, and it felt very smooth. I didn't notice any delay before it was my turn again. I play a lot of grand strategy games where the AI has a lot more to consider, so I didn't even consider Rogule a turnbased game. I still would like to make it real-time, but this could be an easy solution if I need to downsize. [4]
