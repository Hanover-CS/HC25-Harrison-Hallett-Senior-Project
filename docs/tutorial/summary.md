## Summary
In this tutorial we learned how to set up a super basic room and character that you could use to implement a more complex 2D game. For the room we learned how to implement a basic _tile map_ and _tile set_, and how to use them to create a basic room in the game world. After that we set up a basic character node which allowed us to move a icon around our room and have collision. To do this we created a _CharacterBody2D_ node with two child nodes being _Sprite2d_, to contain and display our sprite, and _CollisionShape2D_ to add collision to our __Character__.  

## Practice Excersises
### Use an asset pack to make things look nicer
You can go to _Itch.io_ and download [this](https://o-lobster.itch.io/simple-dungeon-crawler-16x16-pixel-pack) asset pack for free, and after moving it into the assets folder of your project through your file structure, you can make our basic room look much fancier. 

### Try to implement a different movement style
[Here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/2d/2d_movement.html) is a link to some Official Godot documentation. In it there 4 types of movement outlined, we implemented 8 way movement in this tutorial. Implement one of the three other types of movement.
