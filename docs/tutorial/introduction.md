# Introduction
For this tutorial we will be creating a basic room scene for the character we create to move around in. This tutorial is for beginners in godot who are just starting out making their own games. By the end of the turotial you should know how to create a room using a _tilemap_ and _tileset_, and how to create a basic _CharacterNode2D_ which will spawn in our created room and move around in it. 

# Prerequisites
The prerequisites for this tutorial are that you have read the _GDScript_ documentation and you have _Godot_ installed. It helps to be familiar with the Godot engine, but this should be a good start after reading the documentation. Another prerequisite will be an assetset for the room we will be creating, I'll be using some programmer art that I created on paint thats just some different colored squares I made but you could also download an asset pack from __itch.io__ if you wanted to make it look more fancy.
